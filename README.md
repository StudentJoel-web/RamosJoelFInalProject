Joel Ramos, Final Project
My program I'm thinking of will be a text adventure. It will going through story and have the player experince different places and possiably battle.
Source:adventurelib-master which I downloaded from https://github.com/lordmauve/adventurelib
To run program run it in command prompt, make sure the files are located inside the adventurelib-master folder when you run it.
Had a lot of issues adding the main menu, and computer bits. 
If I had more time, I would try adding monster and other cool text adventure things.
